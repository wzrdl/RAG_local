# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with LangChain

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), a powerful framework designed to facilitate the integration of LLMs (Large Language Models) with external data sources like documents, databases, and APIs. This pipeline enhances the quality of generated responses by leveraging external knowledge retrieved from a document store.

## Features
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines document retrieval with large language model generation to answer complex questions.
- **LangChain Integration**: Uses LangChain to seamlessly integrate document retrieval and language model generation.
- **Flexible Retrieval Mechanism**: Leverage different retrieval methods like vector search, similarity search, etc.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend or modify components like retriever, language model, and document store.

## Architecture
The RAG system is built on the following core components:
1. **Retriever**: Responsible for fetching relevant documents from the document store.
2. **Document Store**: A storage solution (e.g., FAISS, Elasticsearch) for storing documents and retrieving them based on similarity.
3. **Language Model**: A large pre-trained language model, such as OpenAI's GPT, used for generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques to guide the language model in producing accurate and relevant outputs based on retrieved documents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wzrdl/RAG_local.git
    cd rag-langchain
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. **Prepare your document store**:
   Store your documents in a compatible format (e.g., JSON, txt) and index them in the document store of your choice (e.g., FAISS, Chroma).
   
2. **Run the pipeline**:
   You can start the RAG pipeline by running:
   ```bash
   python run.py
